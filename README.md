Hi! I have been working with web scraping using Java, Groovy, Regex and Selenium since July 2020.
This repo contains some basic examples of what I do usually while scooping and crunching data from websites.
I have not shared any confidential data here. There is a lot more to do according to websites that I cannot share due to privacy concerns.

All are demo scripts; no real scripts are shared.

Hope you get some help from here. 
Thanks!
